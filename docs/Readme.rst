Vinisto
-------

Vinisto is the word for "butler" in `Esperanto <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto>`_.

It's based on the following main directrives:

    - It has to be easy to expand
    - Non-strict, you may do as you please
    - Support many tts/stt systems
    - Multilanguage
    - KISS

But mostly, KISS is the most important one.

Installation
------------

This requires pyaudio.
I recommend installing pyaudio from your package manager
It also requires pygame, wich requires the same treatment.

IE debian:

::

    apt-get install python-pyaudio python-pygame

After that, pip install vinisto will do the magic.

Executing vinisto
-----------------

Vinisto is ready to use as a library, wich is it's main goal, but you can try
with some default plugins (time and repeat) by using the built-in "vinisto"
command

::

    usage: vinisto [-h]
                   [--plugins [{vinisto.plugins.gpio,vinisto.plugins.ir,vinisto.plugins.repeat,vinisto.plugins.time}]]
                   [--stt {vinisto.stt.google_stt}]
                   [--tts {vinisto.tts.google_tts}] [--keyword KEYWORD]
                   [--rate RATE] [--language LANGUAGE] [--key KEY]
                   [--response_phrase RESPONSE_PHRASE]

    Vinisto - Your personal butler

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --plugins [{vinisto.plugins.gpio,vinisto.plugins.ir,vinisto.plugins.repeat,vinisto.plugins.time}]
                            List of plugin modules
      --stt {vinisto.stt.google_stt}
                            List of stt modules
      --tts {vinisto.tts.google_tts}
                            List of tts modules
      --keyword KEYWORD     Keyword to wait for
      --rate RATE           Mic rate, defaults to raspberry pi USB (24000)
      --language LANGUAGE   Language to use in both TTS and STT
      --key KEY             Key to be passed to STT engines.
      --response_phrase RESPONSE_PHRASE
                            What to say when the keyword has been detected


wich WAS (now it handles arguments, but still...) basically

::

    from vinisto.tts.google_tts import GoogleTTS
    from vinisto.stt.google_stt import GoogleSTT
    from vinisto.plugins.time import Time
    from vinisto.plugins.repeat import Repeat

    vinisto = Vinisto()
    vinisto.stt = GoogleSTT('es-ES', {'rate': 24000},
                            "AIzaSyCuOvb2qd0mhQRkIbGAcgMUmFQaLIXtlmg")
    vinisto.tts = GoogleTTS('es-ES')
    vinisto.register_plugin(Time)
    vinisto.register_plugin(Repeat)
    while True:
        vinisto.execute_callbacks()



Expanding vinisto
-----------------

Vinisto has a simple-yet-effective structure, a main package with packages for
each of the principal functionalities:

    - tts
    - stt
    - plugins

Previous usage example is perfect to illustrate how to use them.
And `vinisto.tts.google_tts` for the tts part,
`vinisto.stt.google_stt` for the stt part and finally
`vinisto.plugins.time` for the plugins part


Using vinisto
-------------

Vinisto waits for a keyword "vinisto" (that can be changed on main.py).
After that, it'll receive one phrase, and will try to execute it.


Translations
------------

vinisto keyword is localized, so, in the main translation file it'll be up to each
translator to decide the best name for vinisto in its language.

That's because, in spanish, google was having trouble recognizing "vinisto" (esperanto) keyword.
Currently, its spanish name is "Bautista", altough that might change in a future, as google voice is female, and bautista is a male name.

Translations are in the i18n folder inside the package, and are easily portable.
All plugins are translatable, and currently added to pot file.

I'm looking for translators to any possible language. PRs welcome. 


Communication
--------------

Github issues welcome, PRs welcome (always following a code style similar to the one already here, and PEP8 compliant).
